# Novel

Currently using GitHub as a tool for editing the text itself as well as for constructing the presentation of the work via a website. 

Version control helps me to keep multiple versions ready at hand and visible to me. This way I can gather different drafts in one place and not be afraid to dramatically alter the text as needed. It also prevents me from simply erasing what I have done before I have had the time to have critical distance and decide what's worth keeping.

The aspect of this that is public is something I am still thinking about. Things I am asking myself: Is using GitHub more a tool for of a personal project to overcome perfectionism or is there value in making the creative process more transparent? Do I have a concrete audience in mind, and if so would there be a better platform to find the readers or kinds of feedback and reactions I want or need?

I am also interested in seeing how version control could encourage me to evolve the text into a serial work, which might also be a tool to overcome perfectionism but one that might be more aware of its audience and regularly completing shorter forms or chapters in installments.
