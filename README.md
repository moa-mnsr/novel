Currently using GitHub as a tool for editing the text itself as well as for constructing the presentation of the work via a website. 

### Editing process with version control
Version control helps me to keep multiple versions ready at hand and visible to me. This way I can gather different drafts in one place and not be afraid to dramatically alter the text as needed. It also prevents me from simply erasing what I have done before I have had the time to have critical distance and decide what's worth keeping.

### Why a public repo?
The aspect of this that is public is something I am still thinking about. Things I am asking myself: 
1. Is using GitHub more a tool for of a personal project to overcome perfectionism? or is there inherent value in making the creative process more transparent?
2. Do I have a concrete audience in mind? if so, could there be a better platform to find the readers or kinds of feedback and reactions I want or need?
5. What kind of response am I looking for? do I aim to create a certain feeling or reaction with this work and what would be the right medium for it?

### Exploring a serial format...
I am also interested in seeing how version control could encourage me to evolve the text into a serial work (which indeed might also be a tool to overcome perfectionism). However, I am curious if this approach might make me more aware of a potential audience by encouraging me towards regular completion of shorter forms or chapters in installments with a reader in mind.
