# Writing a novel on Github

## The project (in two parts)
1. **An experimental use of tools / conceptual aspect / performative act** ... using Github / version control almost daily to create a literary work-in-progress. This is meant to show the seams of creative work by displaying the process of prose writing and story development in a public way. The idea behind this is to borrow from an "open-source" ideology from the tech community as a means to counter the ideas of privacy and authorship that prevalent in traditional artistic and literary scenes / contexts. The purpose also comes from a personal project of overcoming blocks about perfectionism, objectives, and creating a final work for display before I have even started the embarassing and daily tedium of untangling thoughts and syntax, and not "getting too precious" about the work along the way.

2. **The literary side or the story itself**... broken up into roughly six scenes which may be thought of as filmic and draw their order from a thought of them as screenplays, but most likely I will present in a poetic form or lyric prose, ultimately. The hub of the story are the interconnected affairs or fluid relationships between past and present lovers of a woman called Ana, who has a child and domestic relationship with a close friend and sometime lover Paul. They are both immigrants but from very different backgrounds in a large city that may or may not be named or referenced in the text (but in my mind is based on Berlin). The six scenes tell a cohesive but non-linear story about the nuances in the labels, devices, and practicalities that bind people to each other within non-monogamous relationships, which mean different things to the people involved.

## The story (in six parts)

*Ana and Milo*

The narrative frame begins when Ana starts an affair with Milo, who she meets in the evening at the school where she works while she is waiting for a moving truck. She is a music teacher and he works for piano movers who are well-known for not showing up but somehow have a monopoly on the piano moving business (and no matter who you call you get them). Milo is completely unlike Ana in most respects and the kind of person that she would usually avoid in her home country, but is struck with something like nostalgia in her longing and protectiveness for him. Milo knows that Ana has a partner and chlid, but is disappointed to find out that her partner knows about him too and is (at least in theory) okay with it, as if this is a great lie and deception on Ana's part to let him think it was conventional cheating, like an extra-marital affair.

*Paul and Katja*

Paul does not like what he knows of Milo, but understands his relationship with Ana as open, not least of all because he still remains connected to an old lover of his (Katja) by partially living in her studio apartment while she is semi-permanently out of the city, first due to her work touring as a dancer, and then because she has another lover/partner with whom she is more permanently settled, but allows him to stay there to hold the flat for her, in case she wants to come back (she comes from money and the flat belongs to her father, so is really not a concern for her). Meanwhile, for Paul, the flat is both a useful space for solitude to write and make music away from his domestic relationship with Anna

  ### Additional  Notes
    
 *I see this project as putting me at a bit of an impasse with what I thought was some very good advice about making creative work from my photo teacher (Judy Linn at Vassar College). She said first that I should try and establish an "impossible goal" as the foundation for a project, and second "don't tell anybody" -- to keep the specific idea behind it more or less secret from the audience if asked (namely, the other professors or students at the art critique) as a means of propelling creative exploration essentially for its own sake (as I understood it, anyway).* 

*I think that's a great model for making work but I also want to not be overly private about what I am thinking about in creating the notes for this project. I want the work to be able to stand on its own as a literary text without the rest of the conceptual aspect / github as tool / open-source ideology behind it, so in the work itself I will stick to the idea of obscuring what the reference points are to a certain extent. But there are also aspect of the texts related to geography or social history that I may want to obscure, as I don't have authority to write about it (i.e. the experience of Yugoslav immigrants in Berlin in the early 2000s, etc.) and prefer to leave a degree of amibiguity about the source of inspiration and cultural identity of the main characters.*
