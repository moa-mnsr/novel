# Writing a novel on Github

## The project (in two parts)
1. **An experimental use of tools / conceptual aspect / performative act** ... using Github / version control almost daily to create a literary work-in-progress. This is meant to show the seams of creative work by displaying the process of prose writing and story development in a public way. The idea behind this is to borrow from an "open-source" ideology from the tech community as a means to counter the ideas of privacy and authorship that prevalent in traditional artistic and literary scenes / contexts. The purpose also comes from a personal project of overcoming blocks about perfectionism, objectives, and creating a final work for display before I have even started the embarassing and daily tedium of untangling thoughts and syntax, and not "getting too precious" about the work along the way.

2. **The literary side or the story itself**... broken up into roughly six scenes which may be thought of as filmic and draw their order from a thought of them as screenplays, but most likely I will present in a poetic form or lyric prose, ultimately. The hub of the story are the interconnected affairs or fluid relationships between past and present lovers of a woman called Ana, who has a child and domestic relationship with a close friend and sometime lover Paul. They are both immigrants but from very different backgrounds in a large city that may or may not be named or referenced in the text (but in my mind is based on Berlin). The six scenes tell a cohesive but non-linear story about the nuances in the labels, devices, and practicalities that bind people to each other within non-monogamous relationships, which mean different things to the people involved.

  ### Additional  Notes
    
 *I see this project as putting me at a bit of an impasse with what I thought was some very good advice about making creative work from my photo teacher (Judy Linn at Vassar College). She said first that I should try and establish an "impossible goal" as the foundation for a project, and second "don't tell anybody" -- to keep the specific idea behind it more or less secret from the audience if asked (namely, the other professors or students at the art critique) as a means of propelling creative exploration essentially for its own sake (as I understood it, anyway).* 

*I think that's a great model for making work but I also want to not be overly private about what I am thinking about in creating the notes for this project. I want the work to be able to stand on its own as a literary text without the rest of the conceptual aspect / github as tool / open-source ideology behind it, so in the work itself I will stick to the idea of obscuring what the reference points are to a certain extent. But there are also aspect of the texts related to geography or social history that I may want to obscure, as I don't have authority to write about it (i.e. the experience of Yugoslav immigrants in Berlin in the early 2000s, etc.) and prefer to leave a degree of amibiguity about the source of inspiration and cultural identity of the main characters.*
