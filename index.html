      The man at the door
      is too familar, she thinks,
      and will turn her wits to find out
      what it is. Meanwhile he twists the wool
      hat on his head 






     Ana answered the door to a man by himself. She greeted him with a smirk and said she was not so sure just the two of them would manage move to the piano. He began to stutter excuses for the drivers of the truck stuck somewhere up north on a highway, but she smiled at him distractedly and turned away to walk up the stairs. 

     He pulled off his hat and began to follow her.

     He felt moisture of sleet seep into his palms and mix with sweat as he twisted the wool hat. 

     His shoulders moved as one shape, tensed in a tawny jacket, as he tried to angle his boots with each step up so as not to slip. He heard her ask something that sounded polite but not important, and as he summoned the energy to to and ask her to repeat. Though he meant to speak he coughed, and she swiveled to look into his face. She paused watching for a moment, her eyes were alert and flashed with something between amusement and concern. He blushed. She slowly formed the words to ask if he wanted tea.

      As he began to slip and stutter through the noises of apology, she quickly interrupted in her own language, which she knew was also his. She told him not to worry; she knew they were always late. She felt a sly pleasure at the trace of shock and recognition, confirming her guess before he spoke again. Her mouth stretched wide at last in a way that she could feel in her chest, almost against her will. She chafed as she said to come in. He stepped forward and she closed the door. They peered at each other in the faint light. The warmth that had filled in her lungs gave way to a thrash of self-consciousness, but speaking their language together she assumed a code of hospitality and offered him tea before she could doubt it in safety.

   <p>
      Ordinarily, she steeled herself to avoid people from her home country, now many countries, who
      might want to discuss what had happened there, often on their own terms without pause or delay. This was a hazard of familiarity that she often repressed at the onset, staunchly replying in the local language if a stranger addressed her in their own, as she had just done with him. Walking up the stairs, leading this man to her vacant classroom in the school at dusk, she reminded herself, feeling obliged to reprimand herself, that she had broken with a tacit resolve, carefully maintained for over a decade, to make a fleeting judgment
      about the sort of person in front of her and stick by it without a second thought. This was the only tool she had, whittled from stone, to evade this type of interaction at all costs.
      
      </p>
      <p>Indeed, until she had a child upon whom she could rotely impress language (she often thought, with mixed gulit, when faced with his growing resistance to speak it with her), the cost was a
      near-permanent sense of estrangement in the place which she now called home. On most days, she felt this was more than worth the trade. But speaking with her son in public had to her surprise brought about a rare chance to get him to practice with people other than herself. Just the week before, in line at the grocery store, a woman who looked like her grandmother heard them and chimed in.   How delighted Ana felt then to push her son forward into polite conversation as she busied herself with the conveyor belt, swiftly filling up their groceries with her back turned as she calculated how she could arrange for them run into the woman again.

    <p>Now, however, at the foot of the stairs with the strange man who had come to replace her classroom's piano, she did not let herself think further on this; a slate wall shot up between her mind and her stomach in the place where
      the question usually arose: what sort of person was he? A part of her refused to consider it before another part of her could sift
      through what was happening. It felt urgent not to deny him, to deny herself, the instinct to speak to him as they would
      normally had they not displaced themselves, or whatever happened to him, she was quite sure she did not want to know.
