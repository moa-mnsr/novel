        <p class="happy">
            She opened the door; a man stood alone. They faced each other at the bottom of the stairs. A lamp flickered on the quiet street behind him, empty but for a few parked cars.
    
            And how will we move this piano, she called with a laugh, but heard in her own voice a chiding note she did
            not like.
        </p>
        <p>
            Soft lines distressed his face, dimly flushed by the bright room behind her. A bare and wanting expression
            hung beneath the shadow of his forehead.
            A pressure curved the corners of her mouth. 
            Through a spray of sleet the streetlight showed his thinning hair in a warmer tone. His shoulders tensed in
            a tawny jacket.
        </p>
        <p>
            Her pursed lips tightened as she felt a rush at the
            familiarty in him that she had not yet thought to place. Then she heard it in his voice.
            As he slipped and stuttered through the murmurs of apology, she interrupted in her own language, which she
            knew
            was also his. She told him not to worry; she knew they were always late.

        <p>She took a sly pleasure in the trace of shock and recognition, confirming to her before he spoke again that
            she had guessed correctly. He
            couldn't see her mouth stretch wide in a way she could feel in her chest. It's okay, it's okay, come inside,
            she went on. He stepped forward as she closed the door.
        </p>
        <p>
            They peered at each other in the faint light, and in her chest the warmth gave way to anxiety, a sudden
            flare of self-consciousness as she wondered indeed what to do with him next. Yet she carried on with her
            display of easy confidence. Speaking in their language she assumed a shared code of hospitality that she
            could trust would be clearly read, and offered him tea before weighing if she even wanted to prolong
            whatever came next.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ordinarily she had the sense to avoid certain kinds of people from her home country, now many countries, who
            might want to discuss
            what had happened there, often on what they thought were their own terms, without interruption or pause.
            This was a risk that familiarity carried
            and she often chose to avoid it, intentionally replying staunchly in the local language if someone
            suddenly addressed her in their own, as she had just done with him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Walking up the stairs, leading this man to her empty classroom in the school at dusk, she reminded
            herself, feeling obliged to
            reprimand herself, that she had broken with a tacit resolve she held, based wholly on a fleeting judgment
            about
            the sort of
            person in front of her, to evade this type of interaction at all costs, even if that meant a sense of
            near-permanent
            estrangement in the place which she now called home.
        </p>
        <p>She did not let herself think further on this; a slate wall shot up between her mind and her stomach in the
            place where
            this question usually arose. A part of her refused to consider it before another part of her could sift
            through what
            was happening. It felt urgent not to deny him, to deny herself, the instinct to speak to him as they would
            normally had they not displaced themselves, or whatever happened to him, she could allow herself to
            recognize at
            least that she did not want to know. She would make it his task to avoid asking anything in this direction.
        </p>
        <p>
            She was cunning, in fact, at delegating obligations that were in truth her own will or lack of it. It was a
            simple skill of her trade as a teacher of young children. Raising her own child however had begun to soften
            her usual tactics. When she was out with her son she did not avoid conversations with strangers who
            addressed them in the language that they heard her speaking, and she was delighted for him to know that
            these sounds could come from someone else.
