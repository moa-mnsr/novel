    <p>The man at the door is too familar, she thinks. He stands there alone in the cold and Ana greets him with a smirk, saying she is not so sure just the two of them will manage move to the piano by themselves. He begins to stutter excuses for the drivers of the truck stuck somewhere up north on a highway, but she smiles at him distractedly and turns to walk up the stairs. He pulls off his hat and follows her.</p>

   <p>He feels moisture of sleet seep into his palms and mix with sweat as he twists the wool hat. His shoulders move as one shape, tensed in a tawny jacket, as he tries to angle his boots with each step up so as not to slip. He hears her ask something that sounds polite but not important, and begins to summon the air to ask her to repeat; but when he tries to speak he coughs, and she swivels to look into his face. She pauses to watch for a moment, her eyes alert and flashing with something between amusement and concern. He blushes. She slowly forms the words to ask if he wants tea.

      He starts to slip and stutter through the noises of apology but she quickly interrupts in her own language, which she now knows is also his. She tells him not to worry; she knows they are always late. She feels a private pleasure at the trace of shock and recognition, confirming her guess before he speaks again. Her mouth stretches wide in a way that she can feel in her chest but she tries to hold it down, like a cork floating in a tub. He steps forward and she closes the door. They peer at each other in faint light.

      Ordinarily, she steeled herself to avoid people from her home country, now many countries, who
      might want to discuss what had happened there, often on their own terms without pause or delay. This was a hazard of familiarity that she often repressed at the onset, staunchly replying in the local language if a stranger addressed her in their own, as she had just done with him. Walking up the stairs, leading this man to her vacant classroom in the school at dusk, she reminded herself, feeling obliged to reprimand herself, that she had broken with a tacit resolve, carefully maintained for over a decade, to make a fleeting judgment
      about the sort of person in front of her and stick by it without a second thought. This was the only tool she had, whittled from stone, to evade this type of interaction at all costs.
      
      </p>
      <p>Indeed, until she had a child upon whom she could rotely impress language (she often thought, with mixed gulit, when faced with his growing resistance to speak it with her), the cost was a
      near-permanent sense of estrangement in the place which she now called home. On most days, she felt this was more than worth the trade. But speaking with her son in public had to her surprise brought about a rare chance to get him to practice with people other than herself. Just the week before, in line at the grocery store, a woman who looked like her grandmother heard them and chimed in.   How delighted Ana felt then to push her son forward into polite conversation as she busied herself with the conveyor belt, swiftly filling up their groceries with her back turned as she calculated how she could arrange for them run into the woman again.
    </p>
    <p>Now, however, at the foot of the stairs with the strange man who had come to replace her classroom's piano, she did not let herself think further on this; a slate wall shot up between her mind and her stomach in the place where
      the question usually arose: what sort of person was he? A part of her refused to consider it before another part of her could sift
      through what was happening. It felt urgent not to deny him, to deny herself, the instinct to speak to him as they would
      normally had they not displaced themselves, or whatever happened to him, she was quite sure she did not want to know.
