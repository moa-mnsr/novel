     Ana answered the door to a man by himself, street empty behind him. She did not like the chiding note she heard in her own laugh as she asked how they'd move the piano. In the dark hall, she could see soft lines distress of his face, a bare and wanting expression dimly flushed by the bright room at the top of the stairs behind her. She could see a spray of sleet on his thinning hair, lit in a warmer tone by the streetlight past his shoulders, tensed in a tawny jacket. She fought down a sudden pressure at the corners of her mouth that threatened to curve into an odd smile, not wanting to appear mocking again, and embarassed to show the endearment that had struck with a familiarity she could not yet place.  Then she heard it in his voice.

      As he began to slip and stutter through the noises of apology, she quickly interrupted in her own language, which she knew was also his: she told him not to worry; she knew they were always late. She felt a sly pleasure at the trace of shock and recognition, confirming her guess before he spoke again. In her chest she could feel her mouth stretch wide against her will, and hoped tha the couldn't see. She chafed as she said please come in. He stepped forward and she closed the door, then peered at each other in the faint light. The warmth that had filled in her lungs gave way to a sudden thrash, but speaking in their language she assumed a code of hospitality that she could trust would be clearly read. She offered him tea before she could doubt it in safety, and consider the risks of even letting him know what little they might have in common.

      Ordinarily, she steeled herself to avoid people from her home country, now many countries, who
      might want to discuss what had happened there, often on their own terms without pause or delay. This was a hazard of familiarity that she often repressed at the onset, staunchly replying in the local language if a stranger addressed her in their own, as she had just done with him. Walking up the stairs, leading this man to her vacant classroom in the school at dusk, she reminded herself, feeling obliged to reprimand herself, that she had broken with a tacit resolve, carefully maintained for over a decade, to make a fleeting judgment
      about the sort of person in front of her and stick by it without a second thought. This was the only tool she had, whittled from stone, to evade this type of interaction at all costs. Indeed, until she had a child upon whom she could rotely impress language (she often thought, with mixed gulit, when faced with his growing resistance to speak it with her), the cost was a
      near-permanent sense of estrangement in the place which she now called home. On most days, she felt this was more than worth the trade.

      <p>But speaking with her son in public had brought about a rare exception in the fleeting chances to get him to practice with people other than herself. Just the week before, in line at the grocery store, an elderly woman must have heard them and chimed in charmingly by surprise. The grandmother he never had! Ana thought with wild abandon, rapidly calculating how she could arrange for them run into the old woman again (-- What time of day was it? did she always return to this supermarket? could they come here on his route home from school?) How delighted Ana felt then to push her son forward into polite conversation as she busied herself with the conveyor belt, filling up their groceries swiftly while she could hear him struggling to form a sentence behind her as the woman patiently coaxed a reply.

    <p>Now, however, at the foot of the stairs with the strange man who had come to replace her classroom's piano, she did not let herself think further on this; a slate wall shot up between her mind and her stomach in the place where
      the question usually arose: what sort of person was he? A part of her refused to consider it before another part of her could sift
      through what was happening. It felt urgent not to deny him, to deny herself, the instinct to speak to him as they would
      normally had they not displaced themselves, or whatever happened to him, she was quite sure she did not want to know.
