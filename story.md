## Story (arc)

*... a sort of map / note to self to remember the details I have outlined so far. To me this feels like the version of the Wikipedia article you might find about the novel if it were a real book, and it's hard for me not to get stuck scheming out ideas rather than actually writing the text*

*each section is meant to raise a question about the nature of secrecy, transparency, and sexuality / attention, following a similar narrative arc with different conclusions.*

*With the current idea for structure, I've been thinking about the film series [Six Moral Tales](https://www.criterion.com/boxsets/417-six-moral-tales) by Ã‰ric Rohmer. There are recurring elements in the basic story for each film, but the aesthetic and environments of the films are strinkingly different.* 

*I want to explore altering the aesthetic of different sections while raising a similar set of questions*

### 1. Ana and Milo

Ana is a music teacher, Milo is a piano mover. He comes to her school a few times to move the piano, but his employers do not show up with the truck. Ana figures out quickly they are from the same country, torn by war in the decade before. She finds herself feeling protective of Milo and endeared towards him though usually she avoids other immigrants, especially when she suspects they will politically disagree. She has deep fatigue with all discussion of the war and its aftermath, and senses that Milo's outlook would enrage her. She feels guilt for this, for being with him, but also sees his anxiety and unease as a person as well as drawing comfort from familiarity (of language, of gesture, and other tangible nostalgias).

### 2. Ana and Paul

Ana's partner Paul finds out that the apartment of an old lover that he has occupied for nearly a decade is going to be sold and he can't continue to use it as his own. He otherwise lives with Ana and their son, but neither space belongs to or really resembles him. Paul and Ana have been friends a long time, and had an open relationship the whole time they have been lovers, in part because Paul has always remained attached to this old lover via her apartment while she works abroad. They decided to have a child together at Ana's suggestion without greatly altering the fluid and independent nature of their relationship.

### 3. Ana and Milo

Milo is furious to find out that instead of having an extra-marital affair with Ana, her situation is transparent to her partner Paul. Milo seems to feel robbed of a sense of conquest and satisfaction that apparently felt with Ana as a woman with a partner and child. Later when Milo is settled into a turbulent but committed partnership he seeks out Ana as an escape, but she insists on telling his girlfriend. He lies to her about his transparency and when she finds out she ends their relationship permanenently.

// *another character / backstory that might be developed into a few different sections?*

**4. Ana and Trish**

Trish is a mutual friend that introduced Ana and Paul but is quietly disappointed that they ended up lovers, feeling possessive towards Paul but complicatedly in love with Ana. Trish became successful as a journalist after living in Ana's home country, where they met years before. Trish gleaned stories from Ana's friends that were the foundation of her success though her own politics were much more undeveloped and tepid than those of Ana's friends. In this time, Trish depended heavily on Ana while also having feelings for her. Trish's determination for a certain kind of success as well as hiding her sexuality from her family complicated Trish's behavior towards Ana, whereas Ana confidently has queer relationships.
