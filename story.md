## The story

*... a sort of map / note to self to remember the details I have outlined so far. To me this feels like the version of the Wikipedia article you might find about the novel if it were a real book, and it's hard for me not to get stuck scheming out ideas rather than actually writing the text*

*each section is meant to raise a question about the nature of secrecy, transparency, and sexuality / attention, following a similar narrative arc with different conclusions. With the current idea for structure, I've been thinking about the film series [Six Moral Tales](https://www.criterion.com/boxsets/417-six-moral-tales) by Ã‰ric Rohmer. There are recurring elements in the basic story for each film, but the aesthetic and environments of the films are strinkingly different.* 

*I want to explore altering the aesthetic of different sections while raising a similar set of questions*

### 1. Ana and Milo

Ana is a music teacher, Milo is a piano mover. He comes to her school a few times to move the piano, but his employers do not show up with the truck. Ana figures out quickly they are from the same country, torn by war in the decade before, and feels herself protective of Milo and endeared towards him though usually she avoids other immigrants. She has deep fatigue with discussing politics and what has happened there, and and senses that Milo's depiction would enrage her and they would not at all agree. She feels guilt for this, but also sees his anxiety and unease as a person as well as drawing comfort from the aspect of his demeanor th


### 2. Paul and Katja

The narrative time of the second "scene" coincides with the first, where Ana meets Milo. In the second story, Ana's partner/lover/co-parent Paul finds out he needs to move out of an apartment which has never been his but which he has been using for nearly a decade. He finds out about the apartment shortly after Ana's affair with Milo has begun. 

Paul does not like what he knows of Milo, but has supports having an open relationship with Ana in general and since the beginning, not least of all because he still remains connected to an old lover of his (Katja) by partially living in her studio apartment while she was semi-permanently out of the city. 

This situation was at first due to Katja's work touring as a dancer, and then as she pulled away from dancing, it was more because she had another lover/partner with whom she is more permanently settled, but allows Paul to stay in the flat anyway in case she wants to come back (she comes from money and the flat belongs to her father, so is really not a concern for her). 

Meanwhile, for Paul, the flat is both a useful space for solitude and making things (like Ana, Paul makes music, but is not formally trained), and also a sort of object of longing and devotion to Katja, who is always permanently elsewhere and barely interested in him any longer, though their relationship spans almost two decades.  

The flat where he lives with Ana and their son has also always been Ana's, and Paul feels that he has no real claim of his own to anything and that he is somehow ghostly or shrinking with the loss of Katja's flat (but also Katja herself) and Ana's enthusiasm for someone so different from either of them (Milo) who Paul rightly suspects does not know everything of their situation (but not in the way that Paul thinks).

### 3. Ana and Deb

...met in Ana's home country when Deb was a student; Deb became successful as a journalist through the stories given to her by Ana's group of friends. Deb is both dearly close and emotionally depends on Ana and partly in love with her in a way she is not fully comfortable expressing or admitting; she knows that Ana is queer too but also much stronger and more confident than Deb and in some ways in a much less mobile, more precarious practical position as a young person in a country that has been torn apart from war. 

Deb overcompensates for her mixed feelings by offering Ana her place in (the city where they all later live/Berlin but not Berlin), giving Ana a much coveted route to emigrate from her home country. Ana and Paul thus both have as a theme needing to establish their own secruity / practical independence in this city where they have immigrated, but from much different circumstances. (Paul and Deb are from wealthier countries but still unsure how explicit I will make the idea of where they are from). 

Ana is sure-footed and swift about becoming self-sufficient as quickly as possible, while Paul does not seem as motivated towards it and seems to somehwat masochistically enjoy his dependency on Kajta, but much less so on Ana (despite that their relationship is much stronger and healthier)

### 4. Paul and Deb

Deb is ultimately the one who introduces Ana to Paul but then has mixed feelings (predictably) about how close they become. Paul and Deb know each other from the queer community and so Deb is also partly disappointed that Paul remains so dependent on his relationships to women rather than being more unconventional. 

Paul is not succesful like Deb, and neither are out to their family, though for Paul it would not be a problem, it is simply not a concern, and Deb chooses to actively hide this due to her family's religiousness/homophobia. When she was younger she was married to a man who cheated on her, confessed with great fear and distress, and then was surprised to discover she was delighted, as she had at this point in her life realized she had almost no sexual interest in him. He was almost disappointed at her lack of fury, and his relationship with the new person fell apart as a result of the lack of dramatic momentum he had expected. Deb gladly settles with him on the house without a lengthy divorce process and even ends up supporting him for years while he falls listless.
